# How to create and submit a Workflows Template

These instructions will walk you through the steps necessary for creating and submitting a Workflows Template to Okta. Be sure to refer to additional pointers in the [Workflows Template Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/gRp3nNHo/workflows-template-roadmap) Trello board for additional tips and pointers.

## Core Elements of a Workflows Template

### The Flowpack

#### Goal: Build the use case in a way that’s not only functional, but understandable to someone seeing it for the first time. 

##### Guidance:

*   Major steps should be annotated using the “Notes” feature.
*   Make sure it aligns to the list of [supported use cases](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Workflows/workflows-main.htm?cshid=ext-Okta-workflows).

### Title

#### Goal: This is what a customer will see when they’re browsing the catalog.

##### Guidance:

*   Make it clear, avoid big words
*   Active voice, start with a verb
*   Limit: 72 characters

### Description

#### Goal: What it does, why it’s valuable, and how the template works.

##### Guidance:

*   3 to 5 sentences
*   Can be the same as your Overview section of your doc (below)

### Links

#### Goal: Attach links to the following files to the Trello card for your Template.

##### Guidance:

*   Please provide links with friendly names to the Trello card versus attachments from your computer. Links from Google Drive, Box, GitHub, etc. are acceptable as long as we have access to them.
    *   Link to your setup guide (either a Google Doc or a markdown document named read.md).
    *   Link to your Flowpack
    *   Link to your video walk-through
    *   Any other links that may be helpful, such as code samples, diagrams, screen shots, etc.

### Setup Documentation

#### Goal: Step-by-step guide for how to get the template up and running.

##### Guidance:

*   Assume the user starts from the installed flowpack/folder - you don’t need to explain navigating to the workflows console, etc.
*   Includes Okta config (eg create a user with a factor), setting up connections, etc
*   Does NOT need to include every step on how to build the flow from scratch.

##### Format: 

*   Please use this setup guide template as a starting point: [TODO Update this with the link to the doc template](www.google.com). The template is a markdown document, which is the final format that will be used by the product. Please use this template and attach a link your setup guide in markdown if possible.
*    If you are unfamiliar with markdown, you can simply copy the body of the template into a Google Doc and attach the link to that document in the Trello card. Or, if you are ambitious you could try converting your Google Doc to markdown by using this Google Doc extension: [https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607.](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607.)
